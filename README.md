  MetaRoute is a passion project made for personal experience and exploration. It's a fully fleged API framework with tons of built in features. It operates through the use of decorators. The biggest reason for building this project was to try to make an API framework with next to no dependencies. The only dependencies used currently is Socket.IO & reflect-metadata.

## Features 🚀

- 🏗️ **Code-First Database Implementation:** Define your database schema directly in your code using annotations like @DatabaseEntity, @Column, @NullableColumn, and more.

- 🔒 **Route Caching:** Optimize performance by caching frequently accessed routes with support for time-to-live (TTL) and maximum size settings.

- 🔐 **JWT Authorization:** Secure your API endpoints with JSON Web Token (JWT) authorization. Use the @Auth annotation to restrict access based on user authentication.

- 📧 **Email Server:** Send emails effortlessly using MetaRoute's built-in SMTP email server. Streamline communication with users by integrating email functionality into your applications.

- 🎨 **Templating Engine:** Generate dynamic content with ease using MetaRoute's templating engine. Create HTML templates with embedded logic, variables, and expressions for dynamic rendering.

- 🧠 **Memory Manager:** Manage memory efficiently with MetaRoute's memory manager. Optimize resource usage and prevent memory leaks in your applications.

- ✅ **Data Validation:** Ensure data integrity and validity using MetaRoute's data validation features. Annotate your data models with validation rules and enforce them in API routes.

- 🛡️ **API Key Guard:** Protect your API endpoints with API key authentication. Safeguard sensitive data and restrict access to authorized users by validating API keys.

- 📝 **Logging Service:** Track and analyze application activity with MetaRoute's logging service. Monitor system events, errors, and user interactions to maintain visibility and troubleshoot issues effectively.

- ⚙️ **Configuration Service:** Simplify environment configuration management with MetaRoute's configuration service. Seamlessly handle environment variables across different deployment environments.

- 🔄 **Auto-Loading Files:** Automatically load files at runtime with MetaRoute's file auto-loading feature. Eliminate the need for explicit imports and streamline file management in your projects.

- 🎀 **Decorative Approach to Controller/Route Management:** Organize and manage your API routes with a decorative approach. Use annotations like @Controller, @Get, @Post, etc., to define controllers and routes intuitively.

- 📡 **Socket.IO Server Implementation:** Enable real-time communication with MetaRoute's Socket.IO server implementation. Define socket namespaces and handle events for seamless event-based communication.
